# Summative Proposal
## My Program
My program’s purpose is to organize all my current knowledge on health, fitness, and muscle growth into one versatile program designed to generate a proper training schedule and or workout routine for a specified goal. It will be capable of structuring your workouts in a fashion that makes sense for your goals, and it will be capable of specifying what you need to do on which days of the week. My program will not suggest individual exercises and weighting simply because this requires a great deal of self awareness. 

## App Format
My program will begin by setting up a profile and asking a series of questions…
- Name
- Age
- Weight 
- Body Fat %
- What are you goal(s) (choices provided)
- How many days of the week are you willing to train (Min 3, Max 7)
A list of workouts will then be provided along with a schedule providing which days of the week to do which workout.
